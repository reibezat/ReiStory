There once lived a man named Brandon. His coding skills were subpar at best. He thought that he could code a game
of tron. 
She met a girl who is good at coding. The girl taught him a lot.

Her name was Chelsea. She had blonde hair and big big blue eyes. 
Finally, he married her and they had lots of children and a nice life.

But ultimately, Brandon never learned how to code. It was a sad life as he never managed to code
a game of Tron.
